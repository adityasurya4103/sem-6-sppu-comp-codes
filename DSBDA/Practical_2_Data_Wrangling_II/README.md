# Academic Performance Dataset Analysis

This Python script analyzes an academic performance dataset. It performs data cleaning, handles missing values, removes outliers, and applies binning to convert data into a normal distribution.

## Instructions

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - IPython

2. **Dataset**: Place your academic performance dataset in CSV format in the same directory as this script and name it `Academic-Performance-Dataset.csv`.

3. **Running the Script**:
   - Open the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE).
   - Run the script. It will perform data analysis and display the results.

## Code Overview

- The script reads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- It performs data cleaning by handling missing values and correcting errors in the dataset.
- Outliers in certain columns are identified and removed.
- Binning is applied to convert the percentage data into grades.

## Note

This script assumes that the input dataset follows a specific format and structure. Ensure that your dataset matches the expected format for accurate analysis.
