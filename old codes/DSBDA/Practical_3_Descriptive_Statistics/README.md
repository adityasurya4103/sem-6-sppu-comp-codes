# 3.1 Wage Dataset Analysis

This Python script analyzes a wage dataset, providing various statistical insights into the data. The dataset contains information about wages and demographics, and the script explores different aspects of the dataset to gain insights into wage distribution, age demographics, and educational background.

## Instructions

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the pandas library installed. You can install it using `pip install pandas`.

2. **Dataset**: Place your wage dataset in CSV format in the same directory as this script and name it `wages.csv`.

3. **Running the Script**:
   - Open the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE).
   - Run the script. It will perform analysis on the dataset and display the results.

## Analysis Performed

The script performs the following analyses:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Provides descriptive statistics for the entire dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
- **Shape and Size**: Prints the shape and size of the dataset.
- **Minimum and Maximum Values**: Prints the minimum and maximum values for each column in the dataset.
- **Mean, Median, and Mode of Age Column**: Calculates and prints the mean, median, and mode of the age column.
- **Standard Deviation of Age Column**: Calculates and prints the standard deviation of the age column.
- **Grouped Statistics by Education Level**: Groups the age column by education level and provides descriptive statistics for each group.

## Note

This script assumes that the input dataset (`wages.csv`) follows a specific format and structure as described above. Ensure that your dataset matches the expected format for accurate analysis.

# 3.2 Iris Dataset Analysis

This Python script analyzes the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of various iris flowers. The dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification tasks.

## Instructions

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries installed. You can install them using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib`.

2. **Dataset**: Place your Iris dataset in CSV format in the same directory as this script and name it `iris.csv`.

3. **Running the Script**:
   - Open the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE).
   - Run the script. It will perform analysis on the dataset and display the results.

## Analysis Performed

The script performs the following analyses:

- **Dataframe Info**: Provides information about the dataset, including column names, data types, and memory usage.
- **Dataframe Shape**: Prints the shape (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
- **Dataframe Describe**: Provides descriptive statistics for the numerical columns in the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
- **Basic Statistics by Species**:
  - Provides basic statistics for each species of iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica), including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each numerical feature.

## Note

This script assumes that the input dataset (`iris.csv`) follows a specific format and structure as described above. Ensure that your dataset matches the expected format for accurate analysis.
